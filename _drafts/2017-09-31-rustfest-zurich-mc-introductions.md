# General Intro

Hello! Good morning, everyone! It is my great honor to welcome you to RustFest Zürich!

As you probably know, RustFest is *the* European Rust conference. Indeed, it is so popular, that even though it only started about a year ago in Berlin, this is already the third RustFest!

Just for my own curiosity and in no way to see if you are awake---can you raise your hand if you have been to one of the previous RustFests? Oh, wow, very nice! That's awesome! Please, keep your hand raised! And now, can those of you who have been at *both* previous RustFests raise their other hand as well? Haha, very good! That's a quite a lot of people! I'm proud of you, folks!

Now, those of you who are here for the first time: Look around you. The people who have their hands raised are the people who will happily answer all your questions and who would love to meet you!

Feel free to lower your hands now.

So, today, we have a nice packed schedule! But before we get started with our first keynote, I want to talk to you real quick about some housekeeping things.

- CoC
- Breaks
- Food
- Bathrooms
- Regular rooms
- locations
- impl period
- workshops

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to talk to one of the organizers or the volunteers, who all have [identifying badges].

Before we get started with the actual conference, I wanted to quickly tell you about a very interesting experiment by Eric Holscher. He invented something called the 'Pac-Man Rule at Conferences' to help people feel welcome to join groups and meet new folks. The idea is the following:

> When standing as a group of people, always leave room for 1 person to join your group.
>
> More memorably, stand like Pac-Man!

I think that's a great idea, and we should all try to follow it here!

# Felix Klock

Our first speaker for today is Felix Klock. Felix is a research engineer at Mozilla, part of both the language and the compiler team. Felix is one of those great minds that always think ahead. Literally: Today, he's talking about Christmas.

Oh, and before I forget: He is also famous for being the only person to give the first keynote at two different RustFests… or he is about to! Without further ado, Felix Klock, ladies and gentlemen!

# Élisabeth Henry

From her bio, I can infer that Élisabeth really likes to write: She's not just a programmer but also author of fantasy novels.

# Geoffroy Couprie

Next up, we have Geoffroy Couprie. He handles security and quality assurance at Clever Cloud, but is also known for his involvement in the VideoLAN project—you know, the traffic cone people—and he is the author of the quote famous `nom` parser library. `nom` itself became quite famous early on for not just being a tool to write very fast and safe parser in, but also as one of the most macro-heavy crates ever.

For some reason, Geoffroy wrote his abstract as a poem. Is writing abstracts that rhyme a thing now? We'll see. Anyway, it's quite good, and it took me a while to learn it by heart, so I didn't have much time to ask Geoffroy any questions. Here it goes:

> Shall I compare thee to a summer's day  
> Thou art more lovely and more temp'rate  
> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May  
> And summer's lease has all to short a date.
>
> Some time too hot—

Wait, that's not Geoffroy's, sorry. [leaf through some pages] Okay, let me just read it to you:

> Many times you must reuse code  
> And your generics aren’t commode  
> Can you deal in the macro dark arts  
> Recompose code of similar parts  
> Or would the compiler explode?  
>
> Rejoice! Follow now our ways  
> Unlock the compiler’s high praise  
> Listen here to this initiation  
> Each eldritch arcane incantation  
> Summons help ‘gainst the terrors we face.  

# Alex Burka

Wow, you folks seem to enjoy macros. Which is great news, because Alex Burka will dive into that some more. Alex is a robotics graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. He got into Rust by writing his research software (a hardware controller and web interface for a sensor suite), and continues to spend too much of his free time writing macros.

As you might know, there are two kinds of people: Those who enjoy messing around with meta-programming until they are able to run brainfuck, and those who look at you weirdly when you start talking about it; almost like they don't even know what Turing completeness means. For those in the first category as well as those who want to join them, this talk is for you.

When I was chatting with Alex earlier, I just had to know his answer to this very important question: What's your favorite esoteric programming language? The only answer I got was "Whitespace."

# Mohammed Makhlouf

Real-time stream processing

# Thomas Wickham

When I asked Florian for some MC-ing advice, he told me: "Be spontaneous, but try not to tell bad jokes you haven't tried beforehand." That's great advice, I really liked that. It may seem a bit paradoxical, but so is the word black light.

Anyway, I can tell you: The bad jokes I've been telling you today? I've tested them all.

And that brings us to our next speaker! Thomas is a consultant specializing in agile development and software craftsmanship. And he is here to talk to you about Test-Driven Development.

# Igor Matuszewski

IDE

# Niklas Adolfsson

IoT

# Andrea Lattuada

Okay, people, I have one more thing where I need all of you to do a thing. Can you, after I count to three, yell the single most awesome feature of Rust? Ready? 1… 2… 3! Hey, who said "Session Types?" Congratulations, this next talk is dedicated to you!

# Jorge Aparicio

Embedded Rust

# Pierre Krieger

C wrappers

# Andre Bogus

It is my pleasure to introduce our next speaker: Andre Bogus. Andre is a man who is not famous for a single thing, no, he is famous for *a lot* of things! But, to keep this introduction short, I'll just highlight three aspects of what he does in the Rust community: He is a main contributor to clippy, the amazing suite of lints; he is the guy who every week posts and stickies the "What's everyone working on this week?" and "Got an easy question? Ask here!" posts on the users forum and the Rust subreddit; and he is also Rust's resident poet, having written over a hundred limericks as tweets!

So, obviously, there was only one question I wanted to ask Andre: "Can I introduce you with a limerick?" Friendly as he is, he replied, "of course. Limericks are really easy; give it try!"

So, here goes nothing:

> Let me introduce to you, my friend and our next speaker, Andre Bogus! He is…
>
> Known for his love of paperclips,
> and for writing good limericks
> with rhymes that work
> -- unlike this search
> for a funny introduction.

# Lisa

Works at Travis, lives in Berlin

I have to admit: I've seen Lisa talk about games she wrote two times this year already, at clojure.d and at RustFest Kyiv. But she managed something incredible: While I'm usually *really* bad at remembering specific things, I still remember the games she talked about! See, there was Manzana Attack in Kyiv, and… one with a vampire who goes out shopping at night and random criminals try to rob her.

So, obviously, I needed to ask Lisa a very serious, game-related question: Did you ever go to a sportsball game? Lisa looked at me confused, but finally admitted that she didn't really follow the Bundesliga and had no idea what I was talking about.

# Outro

Thank you! That was the first day of RustFest Zürich!

- dinner? party?

# Intro Day 2

# Alex Crichton

If you have ever looked at any official Rust project, you've also probably come across a chunk of code written by Alex. He's been at Mozilla research since 2014 and is part of the Rust core team, as well as the author of many famous libraries, most recently futures, and tokio.

I first met Alex in the spring of 2016, when he was visiting our lovely Rust user group in Cologne. I remember this quite vividly, as that was also the time when, after some Kölsch, we talked about him going to international boy scout events and some of his secret plans to take over the Rust project to speed up the coming AI singularity. But anyway, that's not really important here. Today, he's going to talk about a different kind of future.

Thus, it only seemed fitting to ask Alex one very important question: What is your favorite *indie* time travel movie, and why is it Primer?
