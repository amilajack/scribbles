I want to write tools
that make writing and improving code
accessible to more people.

Since summer 2017,
I've been part of the Rust dev tools team.
My role thus far has been more advisory,
but I'm not maintaining any of the 'big' tools
(like clippy or rls).
But I have to say:
Writing tools for software developers is interesting.
Developers are a target audience I'm quite familiar with
(as I myself write code ever day),
so I can test the usefulness of these tools on myself,
while at the same time
it's totally fine not to polish them much
and just tell people to clone the repo
if they want to compile them in a way that works for them.

The general question: How can I make this program better?

## Code formatting

Rustfmt

## Code style

Clippy, Rustfix

## Docs

rustdoc2 is on its way

parse doc comments and extract information: [machine-readable-doc-comments]

## Profiling

cargo profile run
