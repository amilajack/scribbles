There [seems](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N/status/728749777999925248) to be a PDF out there somewhere from CPP Con, but I couldn't find it.

## The original cards

Cards visible in the picture. Would love to add some own ideas later on.

### White

- template meta-programming
- debugging with print statements
- a sharply worded assertion
- adding another layer of abstraction
- "clever" programming
- other people's code
- global variables
- semantically important whitespace
- templated conditionals
- elegant, but impractical, code
- opening braces on new lines

### Black

- Only use \______ if you are truly desperate.
